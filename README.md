Video and Audio Note Taking Application

## What problem does your capstone address?
With all of the content that an average person watches daily (especailly during COVID) sometimes it's hard to remember where we saw something and even more importantly what information is needed about that video.

## Overview:
Ribboned is a where users can reference notes about a video. The user is able to have many notes to a video and save a note at a timestamp in that video. 

## User Focused Goals
The video will pause if the user stops to take notes and only continue after. Based on the type of videoes the user saves there will be suggested videoes based on that topic.
